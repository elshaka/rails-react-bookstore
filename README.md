# Rails + React bookstore

A simple Rails backend + React frontend CRUD app.

The intention of this project is to come up with a lean convention for a Rails + React app that uses a single repo for everything but at the same time mantains a strict separation (within reason) between the two components.

The idea is that a ruby/rails dev wouldn't need to worry (much) about the react bits and the same thing the other way around for a react dev.

More details are on the way, I have no idea what of I'm doing :D
